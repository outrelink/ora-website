ORA is the all-in-one platform designed specifically for content creators to manage their brand collaborations, track deals, and grow their business professionally.

**What Makes ORA Different:**

**🔍 See Real Reviews Before You Work With Brands & Agencies**
Never go into a collaboration blind. ORA's Brand Vault lets you see authentic reviews from other creators who've worked with brands and agencies. Know who pays on time, who's easy to work with, and who to avoid - all from real creator experiences. Make informed decisions and protect yourself from bad partnerships.

**💰 Smart Rate Calculator - Know Your Worth**
Stop guessing what to charge. Our intelligent rate calculator analyzes your follower count, engagement rates, content type, and market data to suggest fair rates for your work. No more undercharging or awkward negotiations - get paid what you're actually worth based on real market data.

**📋 AI Contract Analysis - Protect Your Rights**
Contracts can be confusing and full of hidden clauses. ORA's Contract Guard AI analyzes every contract before you sign, highlighting risky terms, unfair clauses, and potential red flags. Get instant insights on payment terms, usage rights, exclusivity clauses, and more. Sign with confidence knowing you're protected.

**🎯 Opportunity Pipeline - Never Miss a Deal**
Turn every inquiry into an opportunity. Track potential collaborations from first contact through to signed deals. See which brands are interested, follow up automatically, and never let a good opportunity slip through the cracks. Your entire sales pipeline, organized in one place.
